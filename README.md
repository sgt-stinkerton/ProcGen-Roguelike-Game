# Roguelike Game
Inspired by the art and gameplay of various roguelikes, this game was my A-level Computer Science project. I spent a lot of my summer between year 12 and 13 crafting this game's mechanics (and hand-drawing all of the assets), and I'm too proud of it not to show it off on here. 

The game features:
- **Procedurally Generated Dungeon Layouts** 
- **FSM architecture controlling flow of game states**
- **Enemy behaviour scripting** 
- **A bespoke save-game system**
